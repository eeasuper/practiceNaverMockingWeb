get around to add Bcrypt authentication in backend, currently it is using default generated security password. (I don't know if the default is Bcrypt or not either)

Add Hateoas to Backend. For now it's just regular JSON.

clicking on shopping product should increase quantity...
make  that happen when connecting to backend...

things that could be improved: 
--the design of the popupmenu from /shopping. 
--->could do: green to purple gradient for the borders of the menu. On hover, make box background have a darker gray color, make it wider, add some more padding(to give more space).
--> could add SALT to password hashing...(for backend)
